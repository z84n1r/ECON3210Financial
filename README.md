Blended -learning delivery 
The courseis deliveredin ablended   learning   mode.Students self study   online   on   LearnX   the   content   through   lecturers   videos,reading,MCQ   and
problems at their own   pace.They then attend a two-hourtutorialwhere   many   group   activities   and   discussions   take   place   to   apply   the   knowledge   to   more    exam-oriented    questions.We    apply    the   threcolour   scheme,in   which    differentiatedparalle    utorialactivities    accommodateallevels    of
preparation and confidence.Finally,students meet the course coordinator   in the workshop   the   week   after   the   tutorial   In   these   workshops,Frederique      complements the online content with   recent trends,when   needed,critical   thinking activities   around   articles   and   data,and   more   challenging   problems      thanthe   ones   seenintutorials.As   workshops   prepareforthe   higher-orderthinking   questions   of   theassignments,attendanceis   highly   recommended.
The self study online material for each topic has   beendvided   into   3   to   5   subsections   that   are   self contained   and   can   therefore   beeasilystudied   in   separateshort sessions.The self study content   is   released at   leasttwo weeks   ahead   of   related   tutorials   for   maximum   flexibility.
Internal delivery Tutorials   are   offred   either   exclusively   face   to   face   on   Campus(recommended   option)or   exclusivelyon   Zoom,with   no   hybrid   option.Workshops   and   consultations   aredelivered   in   an   hybrid   mode,with   studentsattending face to face   on   Campus   (recommended   option)while   simultaneously   others         are   on Zoom.Werecommend face to facewhenever   possible   as   interactions with   peers   and   instructors   are   morespontaneousthis   way.

Course Changes in Response to Previous Student Feedback 
In 2023,with   most students returning to   internal   mode delvery,we are   able to   reintroduce   a   closed   book   supervised   exam   in   the   exam   period for 45%   of the final   mark,asit   used   to   bebefore   Covid   hit.With   many   students   providing feedback   that   they   cannot   commit   the   time   to   long   assessment,we      have   also   reintroduced   a   90mn   mid   term   examduring workshop   timeslot   for 40%;whil   short,itis   online   and   open   booked   for 40%.From   lastyear we   retaina   15%open   bookunsupervised   take   home   assessment   allowing   to   check   that   thefoundations   taught   in   topic   1   and   2are   well   nderstod   while   preparing students to the   (high)standards of the   course   (and   possibly   readjust   their   study   and   exam   strategies).For   more   fexibility   thisformative assessment wil   be available for a   longer   period   (7 daysinstead   of   3   days   last   year)and   without   any   timer   (instead   of   a7hour   timerlast   year).
